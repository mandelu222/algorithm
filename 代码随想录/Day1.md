(https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

_Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1._

_You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity._


## #27 Remove Element 
(https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

_Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val._

_Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:_

_Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k._
