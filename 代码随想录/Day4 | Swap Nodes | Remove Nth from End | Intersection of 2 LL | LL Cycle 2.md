## #24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
(https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)


## #19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
(https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

## #160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
(https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.



## #142. Linked List Cycle II
(https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.
